Overview
========

PySWMM is a Python language software package for the creation,
manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and function of complex networks.

With PySWMM you can load and manipulate USEPA Stormwater Management Models.
With the development of PySWMM, control algorithms can now be developed exclusively
in Python which allows the use of functions and objects as well as storing and
tracking hydraulic trends for control actions.


Who uses PySWMM?
----------------

PySWMM is used by engineers, modelers, and researchers who want to streamline
stormwater modeling optimization, controls, and post-processing results.

Goals
-----
PySWMM is intended to provide

-  tools for the study of the structure and
   dynamics within USEPA SWMM5,

-  a standard programming interface and graph implementation that is suitable
   for many applications,

-  a rapid development environment for collaborative, multidisciplinary
   projects,

-  an interface to USEPA SWMM5,

-  development and implementation of control logic outside of native EPA-SWMM Controls,

-  methods for users to establish their own node inflows,

-  a coding interface to binary output files,

-  new modeling possibilities for the SWMM5 Community.
